title: Noise recognition
---

This might be quite a silly idea, but I thought that it could be interesting to record and automatically search for patterns ambient noise.

Specifically, it could be interesting to:
 
1. Develop an algorithm that would automatically recognize similar repeating noise patterns.
2. This unsupervised learning algorithm will produce time stamps which will then be used to build a model of the noise time occurences.

One of the obvious sub-problems is finding similar sequences in time series. Instead of minimizing \\( \int_0^T \left[ f_1(t) - f_2(t+\tau) \right]^2 \, dt \\), one can minimize \\[ \int_0^T \left[ f_1(t) - f_2(\xi(t)+\tau) \right]^2 \, dt  \\] now with respect to both \\( \tau \\) and a possibly nonlinear transform \\( \xi(t) \\) (with one known fixed point, for example \\( \xi(0) = 0 \\)).
